# Email & Document Spam Detection System

## Overview

This repository provides a complete, production-ready solution for detecting spam emails using machine learning. It includes data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment, and a web interface for real-time predictions. The project is designed for clarity, reproducibility, and practical use, following global standards and best practices.

## Features

- Labeled email dataset (`emails.csv`)
- Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step workflow and testing (`Email_Spam_Detection.ipynb`, `Sample_Test.ipynb`)
- Flask web app for user-friendly spam detection (text and file upload)
- Support for .txt, .pdf, and .docx file uploads
- Pre-trained model (`model.pickle`) for instant inference
- Modular, scalable, and reproducible code
- Clear documentation and comments for each step

## Standard Methods & Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning and transforming raw email text
- Removing duplicates and handling missing values

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Extracting features such as word frequencies, TF-IDF, and n-grams
- Using `CountVectorizer` for text vectorization

### 3. Model Training
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Training a Naive Bayes classifier using scikit-learn
- Building a pipeline for streamlined training and prediction

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluating performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Visualizing results with plots

### 5. Model Serialization
- Saving trained models with pickle for reuse and deployment

### 6. Deployment & Inference
- Flask web app for real-time spam detection
- Supports direct text input and file uploads (.txt, .pdf, .docx)
- Instant predictions using the pre-trained model

## Folder Structure

- `emails.csv` — Labeled dataset
- `Email_Spam_Detection.ipynb` — Main notebook for analysis and model building
- `Sample_Test.ipynb` — Notebook for testing the model on new samples
- `main.py` — Flask web application for spam detection
- `model.pickle` — Pre-trained model
- `templates/index.html` — Web app interface
- `uploads/` — Folder for uploaded files

## How to Use

1. **Install dependencies:**
	- Install required Python packages as listed in the notebooks and `main.py` (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, flask, docx, PyPDF2).
2. **Explore the Jupyter Notebook:**
	- Open `Email_Spam_Detection.ipynb` for a complete workflow from data loading to model evaluation.
3. **Test with new samples:**
	- Use `Sample_Test.ipynb` to validate the model on unseen emails.
4. **Run the web app:**
	- Start the Flask app with `python main.py` and use the browser interface for spam detection.
5. **Experiment with data:**
	- Modify or extend `emails.csv` to improve or adapt the spam filter.

## Advanced Features

- Modular code for easy extension and integration
- Scalable design for large datasets and real-world deployment
